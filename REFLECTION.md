\# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator



\## What was your approach to designing the schedule?

I picked a simple day structure with a few key blocks (morning, work, break, evening) so the sequence was easy to follow. I kept the activities realistic but short so the timing still felt like a “day” even though it runs in seconds.



\## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?

The main challenge was that the surprise event can replace whatever was currently displayed, so the sequence can feel like it “jumps” when the random timeout triggers.



\## What does this assignment teach you about async code?

It shows that setTimeout schedules work to happen later while the script continues running immediately. A normal script runs top to bottom once, but async code creates timed callbacks that execute out of order based on delays.



\## What creative element did you add?

I added a random surprise event that triggers at a random time, so each run of the simulation can be slightly different.



\## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?

It simulates the order of a day but compresses time heavily, and real schedules can change based on interruptions or decisions. The surprise event helps show how unexpected changes affect the flow.
